# DNS Analytics

The last two tables at the bottom of the DNS page are the `DNS Stats`.

Here you can see the Blocked domains and the Resolved domains on their 
corresponding tables.  

Each domain will appear in it's own line together with the first seen 
datetime and last seen datetime and the amount of times resolved or blocked.
