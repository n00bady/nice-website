# Application State

Here you can see details about the **Tunnels** app.
- `Version` the current version number
- `Base Path` the path to the executable and its files
- `Log File` current log filename
- `Config File` current config filename

Also, the bottom 2 highlighted messages are there to see if the **Tunnels** app has the proper privileges and 
if the base directory actually exists. If those are not green, then the application will not run correctly.
