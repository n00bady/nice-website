# Custom Block Lists

Click on **DNS** in the sidebar under the Settings you can find the Block Lists.  
By clicking the Add button on the top right of the table you can `Add` your own.

## Adding a new block list

You need to provide a unique Tag (name) and the absolute path to your block list file.

## Block List format

Your block list must be a text file that has one domain per line.

Example:
```
example.org
yourdomains.here
thisisanexample.com
```
